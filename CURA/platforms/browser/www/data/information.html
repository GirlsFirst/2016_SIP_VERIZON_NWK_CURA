		This is an app where you take care of a creature called a "metus", which represents a person's worries and fears. We created this app as a tool to combat anxiety in your everyday life. We hope that you use it to center yourself and lessen your stress. The user taking care of the metus shows the user little things they can do in real life to combat bouts of anxiety. </p>
		
		<p> DISCLAIMER: This app does not claim to be a replacement for professional help. If you experience intense anxiety frequently, it may be in your best interests to seek outside help and support. </p>
